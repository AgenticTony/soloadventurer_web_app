# SoloAdventurer — Cross-Repo Execution Order

**One linear sequence across both repos.** The two projects share the FOUNDATIONS §9 phase spine (0 → A → B → C → D → E) but each has its own sprint plan, because they have different jobs (web = acquisition, mobile = product + shared backend). This document flattens both into a single "do this next" order so there's never ambiguity about which repo to work in.

> **Created:** 2026-07-05 · **Source of truth for _what_:** `docs/FOUNDATIONS.md` §9. This doc governs _order_ only. Mirror it into the mobile repo (like FOUNDATIONS) so both sides read the same sequence.

---

## How to read this

- Each step is tagged **[MOBILE]**, **[WEB]**, or **[BOTH]**.
- Steps are in dependency order — do them top to bottom. Where two adjacent steps have no dependency between them, they can run **in parallel** (noted).
- **The one cross-repo rule:** for phases A–E, **mobile builds the capability, web consumes it.** So mobile's phase of a given letter precedes web's phase of the same letter. Phase 0 is the exception — its web and mobile work are largely independent.
- **Sequencing decision (2026-07-05):** keep FOUNDATIONS §9 order — the AI flywheel (Phase B) is built before the growth surface (Phase E). Consequence: referral/SEO arrive late, on purpose. Not re-litigated here.
- ⚠ = safety-sensitive or human-gated (needs sign-off; the loop must not auto-ship it).
- After each step is done, commit, push to GitHub, and merge the PR. Make sure all checks pass first b4 you merge.
- Make sure all docs are up-to-date (see `docs/` folder). after each step is done. /Users/anthonyforan/Desktop/SoloAdventurerWeb/docs/sprints
- Reference all docs before completing tasks. /Users/anthonyforan/Desktop/SoloAdventurerWeb/docs/
- Use all the tools, skills, mcp servers and pluggins available to you.
- ALWAYS REFERENCE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION BEFORE COMPLETING ANY TASKS USING WEB SEARCH TOOLS AVAILABLE TO YOU.

## Current status (start line)

- ✅ **Mobile PR #8** — Phase A backend (meetups/outcomes/reputation) merged.
- ✅ **Mobile PR #10** — Supabase CI repair — **merged 2026-07-05**, all 17 checks green, pgTAP passing for the first time (12 pre-existing defects fixed; see the PR's closing comment). ⚠ Prod note: run `supabase migration repair --status applied` for the already-live 2026 migrations before the first real `supabase db push`.
- ✅ **Landing-page fix** (web Story 0.4) — merged (web PR #17).
- ✅ **Doc-cleanup PRs** (web #15/#16) — merged.
- ✅ **Mobile PR #13 (step 4 — A.4)** — `report_no_show` + `cancel_meetup` RPCs — **merged 2026-07-06**, closes reward-fn v0.1 (no-show penalty now wired + attributed to the absent party). pgTAP 22→36. Phase A backend fully shipped.
- ✅ **Mobile PR #15 (step 5 — 0.3)** — PostHog analytics + consent gate + north-star **`meetup_completed` locked to `meetup_outcomes`** (reconciled from the stale `meetup_checkins`) — **merged 2026-07-06**. `docs/analytics-v0.1.md`.
- ✅ **Web (step 6 — 0.1)** — PostHog-js acquisition funnel + GDPR consent, **same PostHog project** as mobile — **merged 2026-07-06** (web PR #20).
- ✅ **Web (step 8 — 0.2/0.3 privacy/RLS audit)** — **merged 2026-07-06** (web PR #21). No service-role key; anon-key only; **fixed a PII leak** (`select('*')` on profiles → other users' email/phone/DOB) via a non-PII projection. Report: `docs/reports/web-privacy-rls-audit-2026-07-06.md`.
- ✅ **Mobile (step 7 — 0.2 safety audit)** — **merged 2026-07-06** (mobile PR #16). Safety surface is mature; tested the missed-check-in detector + **fixed a `dispose()` bug**. On-device/edge-load safety validation remains **human-led** (launch-gating). Report: `docs/reports/safety-hardening-audit-2026-07-06.md`.
- 🔶 **Mobile (step 9 — Phase A finish)** — north-star **TIME indexes** shipping; **city cohort deferred** (`trips.destination_city` is a dead column — no city source exists yet); `events` table deferred to Phase B. **PR open.** Scope: `docs/design/step-9-phase-a-finish-scope.md`.
- 🔶 **Credential purge** (mobile 0.1, step 3) — Anthony-owned. Still gates launch.

**Stage 0 closed** (steps 1–8 merged). **Launch-gating remainder = human-led:** the credential purge (step 3) + on-device safety validation (step 7 report). **Open backend follow-ups (⚠, mobile, need sign-off):** (a) a public-safe `profiles` projection (view / column REVOKE) from the step-8 audit — **now step 9b**; (b) the north-star **city** cohort + the server-side PostHog trigger, once a real city source lands (step-9 scope).

> **⚠ RE-SEQUENCED 2026-07-07 — full project audit** (`docs/reports/full-project-audit-2026-07-07.md`, both repos).
> Two NEW launch blockers were found and **jump the queue ahead of step 10**:
> **9a** (mobile ⚠) the Emergency SOS screen is wired to a non-existent GraphQL backend — the SOS button always fails; and
> **9b** (mobile ⚠) a `USING (true)` SELECT policy on `profiles` nullifies PII/block/women-only RLS gating (this absorbs follow-up (a) above).
> The audit also found **step 10 has an unstated prerequisite**: `/profile/[username]` is a client component behind the auth wall — it must become **public + server-rendered** before consuming `reputation_score` has any acquisition value. New sprint docs: mobile `PHASE_H_HARDENING.md` (+ Phase 0 Stories 0.4/0.5), web `PHASE_W_FOUNDATION_UPGRADE.md` + `PHASE_A_PUBLIC_SURFACE.md`.
> **Target: lift the audit scores** (Clean Arch 6, SOLID 5, code quality 6.5, schema 8, security-as-deployed 4) **to ≥8 across the board before Stage B.**

## Timeline (added 2026-07-07 — solo dev + loop, human-merged PRs; estimates, not promises)

| When         | Mobile lane                                                                | Web lane                                                         | 👤 Anthony (not automatable)                                     |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Week 1**   | Merge PR #17 (step 9) · **9a** SOS backend ⚠ · **9b** RLS repair ⚠       | **9c** PHASE_W starts (W.1 upgrades)                             | Sign off 9a/9b · credential purge (step 3) continues             |
| **Week 2**   | **10c** PHASE_H starts (H.1 core tests, H.2 error spine)                   | 9c finishes (W.2 server-first, W.3 feed/landing, W.4 test audit) | On-device SOS validation (with 9a)                               |
| **Week 3–4** | PHASE_H continues (H.3 women-only ⚠, H.4 no-UI-Supabase, H.5 backend ⚠)  | **10** public SSR profile + reputation + trip pages + SEO ⚠     | Privacy sign-offs (10) · store-listing prep (gates 10b full CTA) |
| **Week 5**   | PHASE_H closes (H.6 deps/Flutter 3.44, H.7 TODOs) · **re-score the audit** | **10b** install CTA + referral + Loop-1 design ⚠                | Dispute-path sign-off (H.5) · merge backlog                      |
| **Week 6+**  | Stage B (step 11) **only when real meetup volume exists**                  | Stage B web (step 12) after 11                                   | Launch call: blockers 3/9a/9b closed + safety validated          |

**Definition of "scores fixed":** re-run the audit rubric after Week 5 — target Clean Architecture ≥ 8, SOLID ≥ 8, code quality ≥ 8.5, backend security ≥ 8 (schema already 8). Anything still below 8 gets a named follow-up story, not a shrug.

## What can run in parallel

- **The 2026-07-07 wave:** 9a/9b (mobile) ⟂ 9c (web) — different repos, no shared tables. 10c (mobile PHASE_H) ⟂ 10/10b (web) — the only cross-repo seams are 9b's migration (cross-check web types) and H.5's dispute design (gates 10's public negative reputation).
- **Stage 0** is the most parallel: steps 1 (PR #10), 2 (web landing), 3 (secrets, Anthony), and 5/7 (mobile analytics/safety) have no dependencies on each other.
- **Within each of Stages A–E:** once the mobile step of a phase ships, its web step and the _next_ phase's mobile prep can overlap.
- **Serial choke points:** PR #10 (step 1) gates all later backend work; mobile Phase B (step 11) gates Stages C–E; the credential purge (step 3) gates real-user launch regardless of dev progress.

## The dependency rationale in one paragraph

The backend lives in the mobile repo and the web repo only reads it, so any capability appears in mobile first and in web second — that's why the order alternates mobile→web within every phase from A onward. Phase 0 is the exception because its tasks (landing fix, analytics, secrets, safety) don't cross the repo boundary. And because neither repo's loop/verifier can see the other, **every backend change must be cross-checked against web's typed consumers before it merges** (the `get_reputation`/`reputation_score` drift was exactly this class of bug). Keep the shared coupling map in mobile's `sprint-progress.json` (`web_integration`) current as the single place that records the seam.
